- Cyber Space 2-7 also has been updated
- The CG Render of Violet is now playable, as well as the super form!

Thank you for still supporting this mod. As of now, this mod file will not recieve anymore updates, as Version 2.0 requires a seperate download- and in need of sudden improvements where a simple GitHub update can't handle. When version 2.0 releases, its suggested for you to delete this version of the mod to save up space.
